# Face-Mask-Detection

### Pretrained model MobileNet was also given in which through trasfer learning, model was trained on the dataset. 
### Real time facial mask detection can be done by running detect_mask_realtime.py which uses the trained model.

## STEPS

1) Download the dataset file, while downloading extract all rar file parts as a single file. 
2) Create two seperate directory for training and validation with each emotion having pariticular directory.
3) To train model, run train_mask_detector.py in anaconda prompt or command prompt.
4) Run detect_mask_realtime.py , which will used already trained model by me to predict dace mask detection in real time.
