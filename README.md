# Face-Mask-Detection

### Pretrained model MobileNet was also given in which through trasfer learning, model was trained on the dataset. 
### Real time facial mask detection can be done by running detect_mask_realtime.py which uses the trained model.

## STEPS

1) Download the dataset file, while downloading extract all rar file parts as a single file. 
2) Create two seperate directory for training and validation with each emotion having pariticular directory.
3) To train model, run train_mask_detector.py in anaconda prompt or command prompt.
4) Run detect_mask_realtime.py , which will used already trained model by me to predict dace mask detection in real time.
5) Make sure that you have all the required libraries already installed as mentioned in requirements.txt, also you can directly install all the libraries by using the command {pip install -r requirements.txt}
